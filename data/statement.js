export default `Hello hi. This is the e-resume of an all around problem-solver that enjoys making web apps with Javascript and following
microservice architectures when deploying and maintaining them . In search of new full-time
and contract opportunities where I can gain experience working with new teams, and
management styles. Presently, I rely on React, NodeJS + SQL to deliver app experiences and
employ microservice architectures to deploy (Kubernetes/Docker) high availability APIs
(REST/GraphQL) on a variety of cloud platforms -- including AWS, OVH and bare-metal.
I'm actively searching for new projects to apply my skills in UI/API development as well as
DevOps. The crux of my LinkedIn automation tool (Sonity Ltd), uses Selenium web automation
and am also interested in unit testing and gaining experience with CI/CD testing environment.
The app is wrapping up beta, and will be ready for public consumption just prior to the 2023 new
year.
Although my trade is software development, I was formally educated in Electrical Engineering
(McMaster) and also enjoy working on IoT projects. Research-wise -- I do try and keep up to
date and am interested in data-science, distributive systems,blockchain and have a
patent pertaining thereto.`
