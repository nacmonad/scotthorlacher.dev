export default `Hello and welcome to my online CV.  I'm an obsessively curious problem solver that enjoys exploring the world by making things.  Presently, I rely on React, NodeJS + SQL to deliver app experiences and use microservice architectures (Kubernetes/Docker) to deliver them via a variety of cloud platforms.  I'm actively searching for new projects to apply and grow my skills in UI/API development. Additionally, I'm seeking experience working with new management styles, working with teams and CI/CD software design.   Although my trade is software development, I was formally educated in Electrical Engineering (McMaster) and also enjoy working on IoT projects.  Research-wise, I'm interested in cryptography, mycology, blockchain and homebrewing.`
